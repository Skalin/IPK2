.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ipk-client
client for solving mathematical operations, connects to server, asks for math operations and sends back results.

All operations are only integer type operations, FP ops are currently not supported.
Client can solve any operation from range +,-,*,/.
It can solve them with numbers up to 64 bits.

The program itself works on a simple base. Client sends request in type of HELLO md5hash(xskala11)\\n, which is resolved from server.
After that, server is responding with mathematical equations, which must be in format SOLVE [num1] [op] [num2]\\n
If the operations is successfully resolved, client returns the result in the message with format: RESULT [result]\\n, if any error occurs, client is responding with RESULT ERROR\\n
This can take any number of iterations. Only the server can stop the process.
if the server wants to stop, it has to send message in format BYE hash

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \ip
Set the IP Address of the server that should be used for communication for receiving mathematical operations.
IP Address can be a IPv4, or IPv6 or hostname
.TP
.BR \--help
Prints the help for this program
.SH BUGS
There are no bugs on me! (of course there are..)
.TP
No other operations than +,-,*,/ are working but the system is ready to be upgraded to solve other operations for example modulo, etc.
.TP
Right now, FP operation are not supported. The clients expects to receive only non-decimal numbers.
.TP
No other known bugs are present.
