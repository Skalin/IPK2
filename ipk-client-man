client for solving mathematical operations, connects to
server, asks for math operations and sends back results.

All operations are only integer type operations, FP ops are currently not supported.
Client can solve any operation from range +,-,*,/. It can solve them with numbers up to 64 bits
.SH OPTIONS

.SH BUGS
There are no bugs on me! (of course there are..)
